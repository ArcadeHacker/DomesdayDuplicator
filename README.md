# DomesdayDuplicator

The Domesday Duplicator is a 32 million samples per second, USB3 based 10-bit DAQ designed to allow the backup of Domesday AIV LaserDiscs (as well as generic laserdiscs) through the direct sampling of the RF data from the optical head (laser) of a LaserDisc player.  This hardware is designed to act as a front-end to the ld-decode (software decode of laserdiscs) project.

This project is currently beta and very much work-in-progress.
Details will be added once the project is ready and fully uploaded to github.
